## About Bike Rental
### Initial Discussion

Bike rental is a webiste used to rent best bikes from the top supplieres. We offers best bikes including high-quality bikes, ranging from mountain bikes to road bikes to hybrids, which are perfect for tackling any terrain.

Our suppliers provide both automatic and manual transmission bikes in the UK, however, availability may vary depending on the supplier and the location where you are renting the vehicle.

After we have built the project in Html, Css and Javascript, now it's time to add other important parts to our application to make it as functional as possible. The focus will be on using Python, Flask, Django and creating the database. After completion of work, customers will have the opportunity to leave comments and ratings for their experience with our company. Also, Admin will now have the opportunity to add or remove the products that we offer. All the new options that have been added are aimed at creating a closer relationship and trust with our clients.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

We wanted to use a colour scheme that wasn't going to distract too much from the text but also make the website pop, and look fun. From the competitors websites, I found a lot of local bakeries were tending to use pastel type colours.

### Imagery

Imagery is important. The large, background image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It has a modern, energetic aesthetic also the image shows very simply and clearly the whole meaning of the web page.

## Technologies Used

### Languages Used 
## Technologies Used
 - Languages Used
    * Python
    * HTML
    * CSS
    * JavaScript
 - Frameworks and Libraries Used
    * Django
    * Bootstrap
    * jQuery

### Software, Frameworks & Libraries Used


* [Bootstrap Version 4.6 ](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap Framework") was used to create the navigation bar, cards and form. They were modified to my suit needs. As a personal note to future myself, whilst Bootstrap is a excellent framework to get stuck into I feel it pulls away from the practising of core CSS, resulting in a lot of overriding.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons "Font Awesome 6.2.1 Free Icons") was used for the stars icons seen on the reviews page and the social media icons in the footer.
* Google Dev Tools were utilized to identify and resolve problems related to responsiveness and appearance. 
* [Github](https://github.com/ "Github") was used to store my project in a repository. 
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/ "Git Version Control") was used for Version Control.
* [Google](https://www.google.co.uk "Google Search Engine") was used to research HTML & CSS.
* [Gitpod](https:://www.gitpod.io "Gitpod Cloud IDE") the vast majority of my time was spent inside GitPod's VSCode Cloud IDE.
* CDNs [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/what-is-cloudflare/ "Cloudflare CDN") and  [JsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/ "JsDelivr") were used for Font Awesome icons CSS minified and Bootstrap 4.6 CSS minified.

## Testing

* Choose the repository you want to deploy from the main overview.
* Go to settings by clicking on the icon on the menu.
* In the left navigation, select the "Pages" option.
* Under "Source", choose "Master" branch and click "Save".
* After it's done, you will see a message saying "Your site is ready to be published at (insert url here)".

### Local Development
#### How To Fork

Forking a repository is the process of creating a copy of the original repository. This enables you to make changes without affecting the main repository. 

To do so:-
* go to the GitHub repository you want to copy.
* select the 'Fork' button located in the top right corner, under your profile icon. 
* Once complete, you will now have your own version of the repository to make changes to.

#### How To Clone

To copy a GitHub repository:-
* first navigate to the repository you wish to copy. 
* click on the 'Code' button (which has a download icon) and copy the link provided.
* in the Gitpod Terminal, navigate to the directory where you wish to place the clone. Then, type 'git clone' and paste the link you copied earlier and press enter. This process can also be completed using VSCode.

## Deployment & Local Development
* `Deploying to Heroku`
- Create a Heroku account: First, create a free account on Heroku's website.

- Install Heroku CLI: Install Heroku CLI on your local machine, which can be done by following the instructions provided on Heroku's website.

- Create a new Heroku app: Log in to your Heroku account and create a new app by clicking on the "New" button and selecting "Create new app".

- Set up PostgreSQL: Add the Heroku Postgres add-on to your app. You can do this by clicking on the "Resources" tab in your app dashboard, then searching for and selecting "Heroku Postgres" in the "Add-ons" section.

- Configure Django settings: Update your Django settings.py file to use the environment variable for the database connection.

- Create a requirements.txt file: Create a requirements.txt file that lists all the required packages and dependencies for your Django project.

- Create a Procfile: Create a Procfile in the root directory of your project and define the command to run your Django app.

- Push your code to Heroku: Use Git to push your code to Heroku. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:
```sh 
    $ heroku login
    $ heroku git:remote -a your-app-name
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -am "Initial commit"
    $ git push heroku master
```
- Migrate the database: Run the following command to apply any database migrations to the Heroku Postgres database:
```sh
    $ heroku run python manage.py migrate
```
- Launch the app: Finally, launch your app on Heroku by running the following command:
```sh
    $ heroku ps:scale web=1
``` 
# Local Development
## How to Fork
To install and run the app locally, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required packages using` pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- Create a PostgreSQL database and configure the database settings in settings.py.
- Run `python manage.py makemigrations`. 
- Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the database migrations.
- Run `python manage.py runserver` to start the development server.
